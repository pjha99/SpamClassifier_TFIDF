# Project Name
Spam Classification Using NLP 


#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
In this Project, we will build and train a model Using NLP techniques and apply Machine Learning 
So that Model is able to predict/classify the SPAM texts.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Used TF-IDF to convert word to vectors.
* Used Naive Bayes as classification Algorithm.

### Technologies
This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project Description
###The example is based on a dataset that is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
###This Project is created with the purpose to  Identify whether the given sentence is a spam or not.
###The Steps Involved are:
*1.)Data preprocessing.
*2.)Createing a TF-IDF model.
*3.)Performing the Classification on the created vectors from TF_IDF.

## Train and Test Data
 80% data is used to train while 205 is used for testing the model.

## Getting Started

1. Raw Data is being kept under the project repo with the name SMSSpamCollection.csv    
2. Code is written under the spamclassifier.py


## Metrics Used to determine results:
*Precision
*Recall
*F1-Score
*Accuracy
